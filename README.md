# My Personal Trading Journal!

This is my personal trading diary, built in power BI. Its main function is to analyze the data of all the trades I make, and thus measure how profitable I am as a trader.

## Disclaimer
The dashboard currently only supports options trading, not stock trading. We can also only handle orders with a Buy to Open and Sell to Close execution flow, so after each open trade, the next trade should close the same trade. We hope to add new features in the future that address these issues, though it would be great if you'd encourage us to do so. to collaborate...
